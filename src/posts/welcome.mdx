Whether you're a potential employer, a fellow enthusiast, or just curious about my work, I hope you find something that sparks your interest and inspires you.

### Who Am I?

I'm Felipe Cardoso, a web developer who loves to break things just to build them again! Over the years, I've honed my skills in programming and web design, and I'm excited to share my work with you. My journey has been fueled by curiosity and a desire to constantly learn and grow. From just a kid making silly games to a full-time software developer at one of the best schools in Santos.

### What You'll Find Here

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Projects:** Detailed insights into the projects I've worked on, including the challenges faced, solutions found, and the impact they've made. For example, reworking an entire web app from the original `ASP` to `React.js`.
- **Case Studies:** In-depth analyses of specific projects, highlighting my problem-solving approach and the outcomes achieved.
- **Tutorials and Tips:** Useful guides and tips based on my experience to help others in the field.
- **Personal Reflections:** Thoughts on industry trends, personal growth, and lessons learned along the way.
