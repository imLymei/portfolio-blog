        My name is Felipe Cardoso and I am a full stack developer focused on web
        development that likes to build new and old things, just like this
        portfolio with a blog! So <span>âœ¨ O L D S C H O O L âœ¨</span>!
      </p>
      <p>
        Jokes apart, I like to build everything that exists to expand my
        knowledge, and try to create new things to challenge myself.
